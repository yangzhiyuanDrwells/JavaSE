先写一个代码体会一下多线程

#### 通过继承Thread类实现多线程代码实例：

```java
package yzy.cn;

public class inheritThread extends Thread{
	private int nums;
	//重载run方法
	@Override
	public void run() {
		super.run();
		for(int i=0; i<nums; ++i)
			System.out.println("singing");
	}
	
	public inheritThread(int nums) {
		super();
		this.nums = nums;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int nums = 5;
		//创建线程实例
		inheritThread it = new inheritThread(nums);
		//启动线程
		it.start(); //继承自Thread类
		for(int i=0; i<nums; ++i)
			System.out.println("coding");
	}
}

```

代码的第一次执行结果：

代码的第二次执行结果：

<img src = "https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200921103712416.png">
.........

每次执行的结果都是不同的


总结一下：线程实例创建成功，只是一个线程实例，调用继承自Thread的start()，才能开启线程，加入到调度器中，等待系统调度分配。从而调用覆盖了Thread基类的run()方法，也就是才调用了线程体。

#### 再写一个多线程网络下载器，对多线程进行更深入的体会

##### 先实现一个网络资源下载器

```java
package yzy.cn;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.net.URL;
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;

public class webDownloader {
	public void download(String url, String name) {
		//借助IO工具类对网络URL的资源进行下载，使用外部包common.sjar
		try {
			FileUtils.copyURLToFile(new URL(url), new File(name));
		} catch (MalformedURLException e) {
			// TODO Auto-generated catch block
			e.printStackTrace();
			System.out.println("不合法的URL");
		} catch (IOException e) {
			// TODO Auto-generated catch block
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
```

##### 然后实现一个类，三个线程同时下载三张图片

```java
package yzy.cn;
/*
 * 开启三个线程同时下载三张图片
 */
public class inheritThreadToDownloadWebSource extends Thread {
	private String url;
	private String name; //存储路径
	
	public inheritThreadToDownloadWebSource(String url, String name) {
		super();
		this.url = url;
		this.name = name;
	}
	
	public void run() {
		webDownloader wd = new webDownloader();
		wd.download(url, name);
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//创建三个线程实例
		inheritThreadToDownloadWebSource i1 = new inheritThreadToDownloadWebSource(
				"https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200719183823584.png", "字节流.png");
		inheritThreadToDownloadWebSource i2 = new inheritThreadToDownloadWebSource(
				"https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200719183720714.png", "字符流.png");
		inheritThreadToDownloadWebSource i3 = new inheritThreadToDownloadWebSource(
				"https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200719180355134.png", "输入输出关系.png");
		
		//启动三个线程
		i1.start();
		i2.start();
		i3.start();
	}
}
```

###### 三张图片都下载成功

##### 继承关系

##### Constructor Summary

|Constructor | Description|
|:---|:---|
| Thread()| Allocates a new Thread object.
| Thread(Runnable target)	| Allocates a new Thread object.
| Thread(Runnable target, String name)	| Allocates a new Thread object.
| Thread(String name)| Allocates a new Thread object.
| Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target)	| Allocates a new Thread object.
| Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target, String name)	| Allocates a new Thread object so that it has target as its run object, has the | specified name as its name, and belongs to the thread group referred to by group.
| Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target, String name, long stackSize)	|Allocates a new Thread object so that it has target as its run object, has the | specified name as its name, and belongs to the thread group referred to by group, | and has the specified stack size.
| Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target, String name, long stackSize, boolean  inheritThreadLocals)	| Allocates a new Thread object so that it has target as its run object, has the specified name as its name, belongs to the thread group referred to by group, has the specified stackSize, and inherits initial values for inheritable thread-local | variables if inheritThreadLocals is true.
| Thread(ThreadGroup group, String name)	| Allocates a new Thread object.
##### Method Summary

|Method Modifier and Type	| 	Description|
|:---|:---|
| static int	activeCount()	| Returns an estimate of the number of active threads in the current thread's thread group and its subgroups.
| void	checkAccess()	| Determines if the currently running thread has permission to modify this thread.
| protected Object	clone()	| Throws CloneNotSupportedException as a Thread can not be meaningfully cloned.
| int	countStackFrames()	| Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.This method was originally designed to count the number of stack frames but the results were never well-defined and it depended on thread-suspension.
