数据流用于操作基本数据类型和字符串

> 写和读必须成对出现，简单说就是必须先写出再读入


### DataOutputStream

This class is the superclass of all classes that filter output streams. These streams sit on top of an already existing output stream (the underlying output stream) which it uses as its basic sink of data, but possibly transforming the data along the way or providing additional functionality.

The class FilterOutputStream itself simply overrides all methods of OutputStream with versions that pass all requests to the underlying output stream. Subclasses of FilterOutputStream may further override some of these methods as well as provide additional methods and fields.

##### Constructor Summary

|Constructor | Description|
|:---|:---|
|DataOutputStream(OutputStream out)	|Creates a new data output stream to write data to the specified underlying output stream.



##### Method Summary

|Method Modifier and Type	| 	Description|
|:---|:---|
 | void	flush()	 | Flushes this data output stream.
 | int	size()	 | Returns the current value of the counter written, the number of bytes written to this data output stream so far.
 | void	write(byte[] b, int off, int len)	 | Writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset off to the underlying output stream.
 | void	write(int b)	 | Writes the specified byte (the low eight bits of the argument b) to the underlying output stream.
 | void	writeBoolean(boolean v)	 | Writes a boolean to the underlying output stream as a 1-byte value.
 | void	writeByte(int v)	 | Writes out a byte to the underlying output stream as a 1-byte value.
 | void	writeBytes(String s) | Writes out the string to the underlying output stream as a sequence of bytes.
 | void	writeChar(int v)	 | Writes a char to the underlying output stream as a 2-byte value, high byte first.
 | void	writeChars(String s)	 | Writes a string to the underlying output stream as a sequence of characters.
 | void	writeDouble(double v)	 | Converts the double argument to a long using the doubleToLongBits method in class Double, and then writes that long value to the underlying output stream as an 8-byte quantity,  | high byte first.
 | void	writeFloat(float v)	 | Converts the float argument to an int using the floatToIntBits method in class Float, and then writes that int value to the underlying output stream as a 4-byte quantity, high  | byte first.
 | void	writeInt(int v)	 | Writes an int to the underlying output stream as four bytes, high byte first.
 | void	writeLong(long v)	 | Writes a long to the underlying output stream as eight bytes, high byte first.
 | void	writeShort(int v)	 | Writes a short to the underlying output stream as two bytes, high byte first.
 | void	writeUTF(String str)	 | Writes a string to the underlying output stream using modified UTF-8 encoding in a machine-independent manner.













### DatainputStream

A data input stream lets an application read primitive Java data types from an underlying input stream in a machine-independent way. An application uses a data output stream to write data that can later be read by a data input stream.

DataInputStream is not necessarily safe for multithreaded access. Thread safety is optional and is the responsibility of users of methods in this class.

##### Constructor Summary

|Constructor | Description|
|:---|:---|
| DataInputStream(InputStream in)	|
Creates a DataInputStream that uses the specified underlying InputStream.


##### Method Summary

|Method Modifier and Type	| 	Description|
|:---|:---|
 | int	read(byte[] b)	 | Reads some number of bytes from the contained input stream and stores them into the buffer array b.
 | int	read(byte[] b, int off, int len)	 | Reads up to len bytes of data from the contained input stream into an array of bytes.
 | boolean	readBoolean()	 | See the general contract of the readBoolean method of DataInput.
 | byte	readByte()	 | See the general contract of the readByte method of DataInput.
 | char	readChar()	 | See the general contract of the readChar method of DataInput.
 | double	readDouble() | See the general contract of the readDouble method of DataInput.
 | float	readFloat()	 | See the general contract of the readFloat method of DataInput.
 | void	readFully(byte[] b)	 | See the general contract of the readFully method of DataInput.
 | void	readFully(byte[] b, int off, int len)	 | See the general contract of the readFully method of DataInput.
 | int	readInt()	 | See the general contract of the readInt method of DataInput.
 | String	readLine()	 | Deprecated.This method does not properly convert bytes to characters.
 | long	readLong()	 | See the general contract of the readLong method of DataInput.
 | short	readShort()	 | See the general contract of the readShort method of DataInput.
 | int	readUnsignedByte()	 | See the general contract of the readUnsignedByte method of DataInput.
 | int	readUnsignedShort()	 | See the general contract of the readUnsignedShort method of DataInput.
 | String	readUTF()	 | See the general contract of the readUTF method of DataInput.
 | static String	readUTF(DataInput in)	 | Reads from the stream in a representation of a Unicode character string encoded in modified UTF-8 format; this string of characters is then returned as a String.
 | int	skipBytes(int n)	 | See the general contract of the skipBytes method of DataInput.



#### 利用数据流对基本类型进行读写


```java
package cn.yzy.io;

import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
import java.io.BufferedOutputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.DataOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

/*
 * DataOutputStream
 * DataInputStream
 * 数据流
 * 1.写出后读取
 * 2.读取的顺序与写出保持一致
 */
public class dataTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		/*DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new ByteArrayOutputStream());
		 * 要使用ByteArrayOutputStream的toArray方法，因此不能使用匿名对象
		 */
		//写出
		ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
		DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(baos));
		
		//操作数据（类型）
		dos.writeUTF("编码辛酸史");
		dos.writeInt(18);
		dos.writeBoolean(false);
		dos.writeChar('b');
		dos.flush();
		byte[] datas = baos.toByteArray();
		
		//读取
		DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(datas))); 
		String msgString = dis.readUTF();
		int integer = dis.readInt();
		Boolean bool = dis.readBoolean();
		char c = dis.readChar();
		System.out.println(bool);
	}
}
```
