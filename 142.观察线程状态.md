#### Thread对线程状态定义了常量标识

NEW ^[A thread that has not yet started is in this state.]

RUNNABLE ^[A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this state.]：调用start方法进入就绪状态或者正在运行状态

BLOCKED ^[A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock is in this state.]：IO和JUC的锁定

WAITING ^[A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action is in this state.]：sleep、join方法

TIMED_WAITING ^[A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time is in this state.]：

TERMINATED ^[A thread that has exited is in this state.]

#### state获取线程状态

```java
package zy.thread;

import java.lang.Thread.State;

public class allState {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Thread t = new Thread(()->{
			for(int i=0; i<10; ++i) {
				if(i == 3) {
					try {
						Thread.sleep(100);
					} catch (InterruptedException e) {
						// TODO Auto-generated catch block
						e.printStackTrace();
					}
				}
			}
		});
		//State是java.lang.Thread.State下的
		State state = t.getState();
		System.out.println(state);
		//NEW
		
		t.start();
		state = t.getState();
		System.out.println(state);
		//RUNNABLE
		
		
		while(state != Thread.State.TERMINATED) {
			//统计活跃的线程
			int num = Thread.activeCount();
			System.out.println("活跃的线程：" + num);
			try {
				Thread.sleep(500);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				// TODO Auto-generated catch block
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
			state = t.getState();
			System.out.println(state);
		}
		
	}
}

```
